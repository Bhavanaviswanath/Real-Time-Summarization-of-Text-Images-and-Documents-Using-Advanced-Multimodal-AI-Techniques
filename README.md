# Real-Time Summarization of Text, Images, and Documents Using Advanced Multimodal AI Techniques

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project leverages cutting-edge multimodal AI techniques to perform **real-time summarization** of various data types, including **raw text**, **images (with embedded text or visual context)**, and **documents (PDFs, scanned docs, etc.)**. The system integrates OCR, NLP, and vision-language models to generate concise summaries that retain the core meaning of the original content—making information consumption faster, easier, and more accessible.

## 🔍 Features

- 📄 **Text Summarization**: Uses transformer-based models (e.g., BART, T5, Pegasus) to summarize raw text.
- 🖼️ **Image Summarization**: Extracts text via OCR and/or uses Vision-Language models (e.g., BLIP, Donut, GIT) for contextual summarization.
- 📚 **Document Summarization**: Supports PDFs and scanned documents using a pipeline of OCR + NLP summarization.
- ⚡ **Real-Time Inference**: Built with Flask/FastAPI backend for low-latency API calls.
- 🌐 **Web Interface**: Interactive frontend built with React.js or Gradio for uploading and viewing summaries.
- 📥 **Batch Processing Support**: Summarize multiple files at once (text, image, or document).
- 📊 **Insight Dashboard**: View summary statistics, keyword extraction, and sentiment analysis.

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. Text Input
- User provides raw text input.
- Text is cleaned, tokenized, and passed to a summarization model.
- Output is a concise summary (extractive/abstractive).

### 2. Image Input
- Image is analyzed with:
  - OCR for text-only images (Tesseract or EasyOCR).
  - Vision-Language model for contextual image summarization.
- Extracted content is summarized using NLP techniques.

### 3. Document Input
- PDF or scanned image documents are parsed.
- OCR is applied on non-text PDFs.
- Summarization is performed on extracted content.
